# LinkStrippa

A cross-platform application that allows people to send links without all the tracking.

## iOS App
LinkStrippa begins with an iOS message extension application that prunes url's of tracking parameters that don't serve users. AdTech companies, media publishers, and social media platforms append cumbersome, unintelligible parameters to links for the sake of attribution, fingerprinting, and, rarely, content navigation. Only the latter helps users, rather than expanding their "share" link beyond tweet length.

Bit.ly shortens url's for elegance. LinkStrippa A) removes the roundtrip to a 3rd party site and B) doesn't require obfuscating the url, only truncating the junk.
